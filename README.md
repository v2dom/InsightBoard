# InsightBoard

## 🚀 The Vision
InsightBoard is a modern feedback platform built to replace outdated employee surveys with a space that feels natural, engaging, and safe. Inspired by the community-driven format of Reddit, it gives employees a voice and leaders the insights they need without the barriers of traditional survey tools.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Anonymous Feedback** – Share ideas, suggestions, or concerns without fear of retaliation.
- **Voting System** – Upvote or downvote posts so the most relevant feedback rises to the top.
- **Dual Dashboards**  
  - **User Dashboard** – Submit posts, browse existing feedback, and engage with peers.  
  - **Admin Dashboard** – Approve or deny posts, manage pending submissions, and ensure content quality.
- **Content Moderation** – Admin controls to remove inappropriate posts and maintain a constructive environment.
- **Persistent Data** – All feedback is stored in a secure database for retrieval and reporting.
